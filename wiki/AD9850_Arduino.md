Using the Analog Devices AD9850 DDS with an Arduino board
---------------------------------------------------------

<img src="Ebay-dds.png" title="fig:Ebay-dds.png" alt="Ebay-dds.png" width="200" height="150" />
There is a fair bit of information regarding the AD9851 DDS (as used on
the NJQRP DDS-60 daughter card) chip with Microchip PICs and Arduino
development boards, but not much for the slightly cheaper and lower spec
(but still good) AD9850. The AD9850 has no internal reference clock
multiplier, so it requires a faster reference clock then the AD9851. Not
having an internal multiplier means that code written for the AD9851
will not work directly on the AD9850 - the code will attempt to set
registers that do not exist in the AD9850.

A no-frills AD9850 DDS module can be obtained from eBay for around Â£4 at
the time of writing (August 2012) and will produce a decent signal from
a few Hz to over 30 MHz. A read of the datasheet provides all the
information needed to drive the DDS chip and get some RF out.

Initialising and Resetting the AD9850
-------------------------------------

These code fragments are written in the C++ like language the Arduino
development board uses.

     #define DDS_CLOCK 125000000
    #define CLOCK 8  //pin connections for DDS
    #define LOAD  9 
    #define DATA  10
    #define RESET 11

    void AD9850_init()
    {
      digitalWrite(RESET, LOW);
      digitalWrite(CLOCK, LOW);
      digitalWrite(LOAD, LOW);
      digitalWrite(DATA, LOW);
    }

    void AD9850_reset()
    {
      //reset sequence is:
      // CLOCK &amp; LOAD = LOW
      //  Pulse RESET high for a few uS (use 5 uS here)
      //  Pulse CLOCK high for a few uS (use 5 uS here)
      //  Set DATA to ZERO and pulse LOAD for a few uS (use 5 uS here)
      
      // data sheet diagrams show only RESET and CLOCK being used to reset the device, but I see no output unless I also
      // toggle the LOAD line here.
      
        digitalWrite(CLOCK, LOW);
        digitalWrite(LOAD, LOW);
        
         digitalWrite(RESET, LOW);
         DelayMicroseconds(5);
         digitalWrite(RESET, HIGH);  //pulse RESET
         delayMicroseconds(5);
         digitalWrite(RESET, LOW);
         delayMicroseconds(5);
         
         digitalWrite(CLOCK, LOW);
         delayMicroseconds(5);
         digitalWrite(CLOCK, HIGH);  //pulse CLOCK
         delayMicroseconds(5);
         digitalWrite(CLOCK, LOW);
         delayMicroseconds(5);
         digitalWrite(DATA, LOW);    //make sure DATA pin is LOW
         
         digitalWrite(LOAD, LOW);
         delayMicroseconds(5);
         digitalWrite(LOAD, HIGH);  //pulse LOAD
         delayMicroseconds(5);
         digitalWrite(LOAD, LOW);
      // Chip is RESET now
    }

All so far so simple, pretty much the same as you'd see with AD9851
drivers. I'm still not sure why the datasheet suggests you only need to
pulse RESET and CLOCK to reset the chip, when I find in practice I need
to pulse the LOAD line too.  

Setting the output frequency
----------------------------

The output frequency is set by calculating a 40-bit turning word and
loading it to the DDS, either via a 3-wire serial bus or an 8-bit
parallel bus. The 40-bit word is comprised of 32-bits of phase and
frequency information and a further 8-bit, 3-bits that set specific
operating (and factory test) modes of the DDS - it is these 3-bits that
cause problems when trying to use AD9851 code with the AD9850- and
5-bits of phase information. For simplicity, I set all of these bits to
0. The datasheet gives the following equation to calculate the turning
word

![](Dds-math.png "fig:Dds-math.png")  
This translates into C++ as

    unsigned long tuning_word = (frequency * pow(2, 32)) / DDS_CLOCK;

using floating point maths. Or as

    Unsigned long tuning_word = (frequency * 4294967296LL) / DDS_CLOCK;

using integer maths. In theory, integer maths should be slightly faster
and more accurate as the required frequency increases, in practice I
find either method fast enough and accurate enough up to 30MHz,
frequency errors are due to the poor stability of the reference
oscillator on the DDS module. Calculating the turning word and writing
it to the DDS module can them be wrapped up in a single function taking
the required frequency as its sole parameter

    void SetFrequency(unsigned long frequency)
    {
      unsigned long tuning_word = (frequency * pow(2, 32)) / DDS_CLOCK;
      digitalWrite (LOAD, LOW); 

      shiftOut(DATA, CLOCK, LSBFIRST, tuning_word);
      shiftOut(DATA, CLOCK, LSBFIRST, tuning_word &gt;&gt; 8);
      shiftOut(DATA, CLOCK, LSBFIRST, tuning_word &gt;&gt; 16);
      shiftOut(DATA, CLOCK, LSBFIRST, tuning_word &gt;&gt; 24);
      shiftOut(DATA, CLOCK, LSBFIRST, 0x0);
      
      digitalWrite (LOAD, HIGH); 
    }

Wiring up & example code download
---------------------------------

<img src="Ardunio-dds.png" title="fig:Ardunio-dds.png" alt="Ardunio-dds.png" width="400" height="300" />
The code assumes that Arduino pins 8,9,10 & 11 are connected to the DDS
CLOCK, DATA, LOAD and RESET lines respectively. Signal output can be
taken from pin 21 of the DDS chip.  
  
An example project that just initialises the DDS and sets the output
frequency to 10 MHz can be downloaded
[here](/wiki/Media:Dds_test-120823a.zip "wikilink"). Do what you want with the
code except claim it as your own and try to prevent anyone else using
it.
