Dave's less formal about-me
---------------------------

I'm old. I was never a child - just shorter than I am now. I'm a
loveable, grumpy old git. I'm stupidly shy unless drunk, then I'm
stupidly shy and drunk. I'm an atheist, a
conservative-anarchist-communist-liberal, a geek of the physical
sciences and obsolete computers. I read a lot. I have a PhD.

I like beer, aniseed balls, curry, red wine, computers and cats. I
dislike religious fundamentalists, children, cucumber, sprouts and
millipedes.

I've worked as a barman, an accountant, a bank clerk, a double glazing
salesman, a road sweeper, an embedded systems developer, a network
installer and I've manned the hell-desk. ~~Now I blow things up with a
big laser.~~ Now I work designing integrated optical sensing technology
based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers and planar waveguides.

I have zero musical skills despite owning at least 10 CDs and having
several tens of gigs of MP3s on my computers. I sometimes write. I often
take photos. I collect books.

I keep finding grey hairs. I cook excellent bacon rolls, pretty good
Thai fish curry, decent roast lamb and appalling cakes.
