Building a BitX 20 Radio
------------------------

The BitX 20 is a 20m band SSB transeiver originally designed in India by
Ashar Frahan, and now supported and developed by by many people. My BitX
is a version 3, built on a PCB ordered from Sunil Lakhani VU3SUA.

**Band Pass Filter**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The BitX bp-filter is simply constructed from three Toko coils and a
handfull of NPO capacitors.

Quickly peaking up the filter response using the variable cores on the
Toko coils give the following filter plots.
