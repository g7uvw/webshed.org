My British Gas supplied carbon monoxide sensor started bleeping at me,
not the usual battery-dying bleep code, but a rather more serious
detector-malfunction bleep code. This makes it fair game for a teardown!

The whole of the alarm is implemented on a single PCB, the two most
obvious parts being the electrochemical sensor and the piezo sounder.
Just peaking out from under the sensor is something that looks rather
like a Microchip PIC ISCP port header
