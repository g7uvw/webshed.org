My British Gas supplied carbon monoxide sensor started bleeping at me, not the usual battery-dying bleep code, but a rather more serious detector-malfunction bleep code. This makes it fair game for a teardown!

== The PCB<br>  ==

The whole of the alarm is implemented on a single PCB, the two most obvious parts being the electrochemical sensor and the piezo sounder. Just peaking out from under the sensor is something that looks rather like a Microchip PIC ISCP port header. <br> [[Image:Co-alarm-pcb-front.jpg|thumb|left|400px]][[Image:Co-alarm-ICSP-port.jpg|thumb|center]]
