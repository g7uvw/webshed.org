== Documenting my experiments with a FUNcube Dongle ==
The FUNcube Dongle is a small USB hosted Software Defined Radio (SDR) covering 60 MHz to 2 GHz. The hardware itself is just a tunable down-converter, transforming a 90 kHz chunk of RF bandwidth to approximately 80 kHz of audio bandwidth, all demodulation and further filtering and processing is performed in software on the hosting computer.
