[Category%3AHelp](/wiki/Category%3AHelp "wikilink") is for MediaWiki generic
site user help. Only pages in namespace “Help:” should be in this
category. Note that all pages in namespace “Help:” are released into the
[Public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) so that they
can be easily imported into any MediaWiki instance regardless of the
specific wiki's own license. See **[Project:PD
Help](http://www.mediawiki.com/wiki/Project:PD_Help)** if you want to
help us.

*Every single English-language page within the set of public domain Help
pages should directly be categorized (additionally putting pages in
other categories to provide further sorting is possible). This is needed
because of later half-automated creation of the PD Help package from
this category.*

The front page is **<Help:Contents>**
