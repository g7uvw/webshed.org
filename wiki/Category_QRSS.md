This is an overview of my experiments with low power, low bandwidth
radio transmissions commonly called QRSS transmissions. The term QRSS is
a derivative of QRS [Q-code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-code)
meaning Send Slowly (or shall I Send Slowly, if followed by a ?). It is
a transmission mode made possible by DSP techniques that can extract
very weak signals from noisy channels.
