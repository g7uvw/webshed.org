Curriculum Vitae for David Mills
--------------------------------

**Profile** I am primarily a physical scientist with engineering
leanings. I have many cross-discipline skills, ranging from atomic force
microscopy through basic cell culture to electronics, ex- cimer laser
systems, optical spectroscopy and RF engineering. I seek to combine my
skills in my work and research.

I am an enthusiastic, conscientious and imaginative researcher well
accustomed to ’thinking outside the box’ and directing my own research.
I enjoy collaboration and discussion with other researchers both inside
and outside my ﬁeld.

**Key Skills**

*Microscopy:* SEM, AFM, STM. Sample preparation and analysis.

*Optics:* Design, simulation construction and commissioning of
spectrometers and optical waveguide sensors.

*Electronics:* More than 10 years’ experience with analogue, RF and
digital design, FPGAs and CPLDs.

*Laser systems:* Usage and maintenance of a variety of cw and pulsed
laser systems, includingsemiconductorlaser diodes, femtosecond lasers
and high power excimer laser systems.
