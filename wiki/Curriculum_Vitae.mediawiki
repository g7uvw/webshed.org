==  Curriculum Vitae for David Mills==

'''Profile'''
I am primarily a physical scientist with engineering leanings. I have many cross-discipline 
skills, ranging from atomic force microscopy through basic cell culture to electronics, ex- 
cimer laser systems, optical spectroscopy and RF engineering. I seek to combine my skills 
in my work and research. 

I am an enthusiastic, conscientious and imaginative researcher well accustomed to ’thinking 
outside the box’ and directing my own research. I enjoy collaboration and discussion with 
other researchers both inside and outside my ﬁeld. 

'''Key Skills'''

''Microscopy:'' SEM, AFM, STM. Sample preparation and analysis.

''Optics:'' Design, simulation construction and commissioning of spectrometers and optical waveguide sensors.

''Electronics:'' More than 10 years’ experience with analogue, RF and digital design, FPGAs and CPLDs.

''Laser systems:''  Usage and maintenance of a variety of cw and pulsed laser systems, includingsemiconductorlaser diodes, femtosecond lasers and high power excimer laser systems.
