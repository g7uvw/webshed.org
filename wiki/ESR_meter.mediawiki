== An Equivalent Series Resistance Meter ==

Some time ago I was trying to repair a switched mode power supply (SMPS) in my oscilloscope. I'd been quoted Â£800 for a new PSU, so trying to fix it first was well worth my while.  It's pretty common for electrolytic capacitors to develop faults in an SMPS; specifically they develop an higher than normal internal resistance. So while the capacitor may hold a charge and measure as the correct capacitance, it will not behave correctly in a filter or PSU circuit.  Suspecting the capacitors, and not having a way to measure their series resistance, I set out to design and build an ESR meter.

The ESR of a large high voltage, high capacity electrolytic capacitor should be fractions of an Ohm, smaller capacitors have ESRs of a few Ohms typically.
