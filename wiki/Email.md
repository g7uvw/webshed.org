Contact Me
==========

The best way to contact me is to email me, due to spam concerns I've had
to restort to a Captcha to try to reduce the potential for email spam
from this source.

Your browser does not seem to support iframes. Go to
<http://webshed.org/cgi-bin/email.cgi> and fill out the capcha. Sorry.

I'm also on Twitter as [@dtl](http://twitter.com/dtl)

I do have Google+, LinkedIn and Facebook accounts, but rarely use them
so they are not linked from here. Email me or contact me via Twitter if
you need my other social media details.
