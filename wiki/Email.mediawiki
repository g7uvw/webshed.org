= Contact Me  =

The best way to contact me is to email me, due to spam concerns I've had to restort to a Captcha to try to reduce the potential for email spam from this source.

I'm also on Twitter as [http://twitter.com/dtl @dtl] 

I do have Google+, LinkedIn and Facebook accounts, but rarely use them so they are not linked from here. Email me or contact me via Twitter if you need my other social media details.
