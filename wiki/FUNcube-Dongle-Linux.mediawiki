== Getting a FUNcube Dongle running on Linux ==
[[File:FUNcube-Dongle.jpg|thumb|350px|My FUNcube Dongle, with an SMA <-> BNC converter attached]]

This is how I got my FUNcube Dongle (FCD from here on in) working under Linux on a Samsung N130 Netbook PC using Quisk SDR software. The Linux distro installed is Ubuntu 11.04, but instructions should be very similar for any recent Linux distro. 

First of all insert the FCD into a USB port and determine that it is detected:
  $ lsusb
  Bus 005 Device 003: ID 04d8:fb56 Microchip Technology, Inc.
The FCD uses a Microchip PIC to handle USB connectivity, so the lsusb command lists the FCD as a Microchip Technology, Inc. device. As long as the hex identifier, 04d8:fb56, is listed correctly then the FCD is being detected and not confused with some other device also connected to USB.

At this point it is a good idea to download the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/qthid/files/ latest version] of the [http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/funcube-dongle/qthid-fcd-controller QTHID FCD control software] and check this this can communicate with and control the FCD. I found I had to start the qthid software with extra permissions to access USB, this is easily achieved 
   $ sudo ./qthid

<br style="clear: both" />As long as the software says "FCD is active" then all is well, if it says "FCD not detected" but the FCD is listed by the lsusb command above, then you may need to update the firmware on your FCD. IN which case, get the older 2.2 version of the QTHID software (this can talk to older FCD firmwares) and use it to upload the latest firmware from the main FCD website. The newest QTHID should then work.


Next check how ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) is identifying the FCD (The FCD pretends to be a soundcard)
  $ cat /proc/asound/cards
  0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA-Intel
                          HDA-Intel at 0xf044000 irq 43
  1 [default       ]: USB-Audio - FUNcube Dongle V1.0 at usb-0000:00:id.3.1
This means that ALSA is calling the built in soundcard "hw:0" and the FCD "hw:1", this is all the information we need to configure Quisk.

Get and install Quisk as documented [http://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/ here]. Quisk requires a configuration file to enable it to communicated with the FCD, this is mine:
   
   #Filename quisk_funcube.py
   sample_rate = 96000                  #ADC Hardware sample rate
   name_of_sound_capt = "hw:1"    #Determined from ALSA
   name_of_sound_play = "hw:0"    #Determined from ALSA
   channel_i = 0
   channel_q = 1

Start quisk
  $ ./quisk.py -c quisk_funcube.py

<br style="clear: both" />The Quisk software isn't fully polished or able to control the FCD directly, so you need to run it in conjunction with QTHID to control the FCD. Set Quisk frequency to a nice round number and then it's easy to calculate the offsets needed for tuning with QTHID.
