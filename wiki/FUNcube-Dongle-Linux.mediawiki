== Getting a FUNcube Dongle running on Linux ==
[[File:FUNcube-Dongle.jpg|thumb|350px|My FUNcube Dongle, with an SMA <-> BNC converter attached]]

This is how I got my FUNcube Dongle (FCD from here on in) working under Linux on a Samsung N130 Netbook PC. The Linux distro installed is Ubuntu 11.04, but instructions should be very similar for any recent Linux distro.

First of all insert the FCD into a USB port and determine that it is detected:
  $ lsusb
  Bus 005 Device 003: ID 04d8:fb56 Microchip Technology, Inc.
The FCD uses a Microchip PIC to handle USB connectivity, so the lsusb command lists the FCD as a Microchip Technology, Inc. device. As long as the hex identifier, 04d8:fb56, is listed correctly then the FCD is being detected and not confused with some other device also connected to USB.

At this point it is a good idea to download the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/qthid/files/ latest version] of the [http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/funcube-dongle/qthid-fcd-controller QTHID FCD control software]







Next check how ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) is identifying the FCD (The FCD pretends to be a soundcard)
  $ cat /proc/asound/cards
  0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA-Intel
                          HDA-Intel at 0xf044000 irq 43
  1 [default       ]: USB-Audio - FUNcube Dongle V1.0 at usb-0000:00:id.3.1
Basically this means that ALSA is calling the built in soundcard "hw:0" and the FCD "hw:1", this is all the information we need to
