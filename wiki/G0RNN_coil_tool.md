G0RNN's coil winding helper
---------------------------

This is a fantastically simple and useful tool designed and built by
**Chick G0RNN** and described to me by **Ray G1OJP**. Constructed
entirely from tinplate from a large tin of baked beans or similar, the
tool provides a third-hand making toroid coils easy to wind.

There isn't a lot more to say, the design is pretty self-explanatory
from the photographs. The only thing to consider during construction of
the tool, is that cut tin-plate will have sharp edges, so should be
smoothed with emery paper or similar before soldering.
