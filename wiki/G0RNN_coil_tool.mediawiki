== G0RNN's coil winding helper ==
This is a fantastically simple and useful tool designed and built by '''Chick G0RNN''' and described to me by '''Ray G1OJP'''. Constructed entirely from tinplate from a large tin of baked beans or similar, the tool provides a third-hand making toroid coils easy to wind.


There isn't a lot more to say, the design is pretty self-explanatory from the photographs. The only thing to consider during construction of the tool, is that cut tin-plate will have sharp edges, so should be smoothed with emery paper or similar before soldering.
