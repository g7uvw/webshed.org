== Radio Callsign G7UVW ==
Since the mid 1990s I've held a few different callsigns for various classes of operation.
* 2E1CZR - My old Class-B novice callsign
* M3UVW - A short lived call I held after passing the 5WPM Morse test to access the HF bands - Ran in conjunction with:
* G7UVW - My current, and longest lived callsign. A full class license, the highest class available in the UK.
