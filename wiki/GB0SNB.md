GB0SNB is the amateur radio callsign for the special event radio station
at the [Kelvedon Hatch nuclear
bunker](http://www.secretnuclearbunker.com), a few miles outside
Brentwood in Essex, UK. It is operated and maintained by members of the
(now defunct) Barking Radio and Electronics Society. More information
about the station can be found on the QRZ.com page [GB0SNB on

The Station currently operates a permanent APRS node on 145 MHz - 2

bands; live WSPR 'spots' for this transmitter can be viewed on the
