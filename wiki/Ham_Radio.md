G7UVW - David Mills
-------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been licensed since the mid 1990s, but only sporadically active on
air for most of that time. Only in early 2010 did I finally venture onto
the HF bands, all activity under my own callsign having been restricted
to 2m and 70cms before 2010. I decided a long time ago that I wanted to
make my first contacts on HF using wholly home designed and constructed
equipment.

Interests
---------

-   My primary radio interests are home construction and low power (QRP)
    operation. I can often be found on 15m (21 MHz) or 2m (144.300 MHz).
-   I'm also active in [QRSS](/wiki/Category%3AQRSS "wikilink") (Very slow,
    very narrow bandwidth data transmission)
-   Purchase of a [FUNcube Dongle](/wiki/Category%3AFuncube_Dongle "wikilink")
    has opened up space communications to me, so I plan to experiment
    more with this.
