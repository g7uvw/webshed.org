I've been licensed since the mid 1990s, but only sporadically active on air for most of that time. Only in early 2010 did I finally venture onto the HF bands, all activity under my own callsign having been restricted to 2m and 70cms before 2010. I decided a long time ago that I wanted to make my first contacts on HF using wholly home designed and constructed equipment.


== Interests ==
* My primary radio interests are home construction and low power (QRP) operation. I can often be found on 15m (21 MHz) or 2m (144.300 MHz).
* I'm also active in [[:Category:QRSS|QRSS]] (Very slow, very narrow bandwidth data transmission)
* Purchase of a [[:Category:Funcube_Dongle|FUNcube Dongle]] has opened up space communications to me, so I plan to experiment more with this.
