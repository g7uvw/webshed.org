== Heart Blinkenlights  ==

I wanted to make something for my partner for Valentine's Day 2014. Browsing the local Maplin shop, I came across a [http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/velleman-mk101-flashing-sweetheart-led-kit-vx75s Velleman] kit in the shape of a heart with ~30 LEDs. In its standard frm, the kit just flashes all the LEDs on and off at a few Hz - it's just a two transistor astable circuit - nothing too exciting. I&nbsp;bought it and started thinking about how to upgrade it once I&nbsp;had it back in the workshop. 

First off, I ditched the 3mm LEDs and plumped for some 5mm ultra high brighness ones, unfortunately I&nbsp;ordered 8mm by mistake so some filing and brute force was needed to get them to fit the PCB. I'd wanted to try [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing charlieplexing]&nbsp; for some time, so this seemed like a good opotunity. I&nbsp;had some PIC16F883 devices in SMT form in the spares bin , these are small enough to fit on the back of the heart PCB and will run with no extra parts - that made selection of controller easy - use those.

[[Image:IMG_20140213_202524.jpg|450x600px]] At the time I&nbsp;soldered the LEDs on the PCB I&nbsp;hadn't though too much about how to address them via charlieplexing, so I&nbsp;just had them in pairs, anti-paralell. I&nbsp;can always fix the addressing in software - however this does make for some odd looking code at times. It would have been much nicer to have been consistant with placing the LEDs such that the topmost of each pair was always at the lowest (or highest) address. The image shows how a few of the LEDs had to have some extreme modification with a file to fit the board.
