== Heart Blinkenlights  ==

I wanted to make something for my partner for Valentine's Day 2014. Browsing the local Maplin shop, I came across a [http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/velleman-mk101-flashing-sweetheart-led-kit-vx75s Velleman] kit in the shape of a heart with ~30 LEDs. In its standard frm, the kit just flashes all the LEDs on and off at a few Hz - it's just a two transistor astable circuit - nothing too exciting. I&nbsp;bought it and started thinking about how to upgrade it once I&nbsp;had it back in the workshop. 

First off, I ditched the 3mm LEDs and plumped for some 5mm ultra high brighness ones, unfortunately I&nbsp;ordered 8mm by mistake so some filing and brute force was needed to get them to fit the PCB. I'd wanted to try [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing charlieplexing]&nbsp; for some time, so this seemed like a good opotunity. I&nbsp;had some PIC16F883 devices in SMT form in the spares bin , these are small enough to fit on the back of the heart PCB and will run with no extra parts - that made selection of controller easy - use those.
