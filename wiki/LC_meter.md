The best source of info for a DIY LC meter is this website
[1](http://ironbark.bendigo.latrobe.edu.au/~rice/lc/)

At the start of an RF project design I found myself in need of a
reasonable Inductance and Capacitance meter (L-C meter). There are
several designs around on the web, mainly based on the design from
[Almost All Digital Electronics](http://www.aade.com/lcmeter.htm). I
decided to build the version from
[electronics-diy.com](http://electronics-diy.com/lc_meter.php).

design.](http://webshed.org/wiki/upload/9/9a/Pcbv1b.png)
