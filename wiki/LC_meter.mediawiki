At the start of an RF project design I found myself in need of a reasonable Inductance and Capacitance meter (L-C meter). There are several designs around on the web, mainly based on the design from [http://www.aade.com/lcmeter.htm Almost All Digital Electronics]. I decided to build the version from [http://electronics-diy.com/lc_meter.php electronics-diy.com].
