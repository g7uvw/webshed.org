Welcome to webshed.org. One of [my](/wiki/About_Me "wikilink") homes on the
internet.

Friends & family that have ended up here are probably lost, anyone
looking for my photos probably wants to be at
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dtl/) instead. Accademic visitors
are directed to my research pages.

Current Projects
----------------

I'm working on several electronics projects at the present time:

-   An Epiphyte 80m transceiver.
-   I'm designing a PCB for the Warbler PSK31 transceiver.
-   A [USB-ZX](/wiki/USB-ZX "wikilink") debugging interface for the Z80 based
    Sinclair Spectrum computer.
-   An accurate amateur level [LC meter](/wiki/LC_meter "wikilink")
-   Poking round the guts of [CP/M](/wiki/CPM "wikilink") on the Sinclair
    Spectrum

I also have a half dozen or so other projects that are currently in
limbo due to lack of attention. As the above projects are completed,
then some of the others will join the list of the active.

Useful(?) Information
