Welcome to webshed.org. One of [my](/wiki/About_Me "wikilink") homes on the
internet.

Friends & family that have ended up here are probably lost, anyone
looking for my photos probably wants to be at
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dtl/) instead. Accademic visitors
are directed to my research pages.

Research Interests
------------------

My PhD was in the area of laser - surface interactions and structure
formation, with applications in as diverse fields as photovoltaics,
cellular scaffolds and transdermal drug delivery. Much of my work
involved optimising the experimental conditions and devising new
techniques to control the formation of nano- and meso-structures.
