Welcome to webshed.org.  One of [[About Me|my]] homes on the internet.

Friends & family that have ended up here are probably lost, anyone looking for my photos probably wants to be at [http://www.flickr.com/photos/dtl/ Flickr] instead. Academic visitors are directed to my [[Research_Interests |research pages.]]
