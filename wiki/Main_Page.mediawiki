Welcome to webshed.org.  One of [[About Me|my]] homes on the internet.

Friends & family that have ended up here are probably lost, anyone looking for my photos probably wants to be at [http://www.flickr.com/photos/dtl/ Flickr] instead. Accademic visitors are directed to my research pages. 



== Research Interests ==
My PhD was in the area of laser - surface interactions and structure formation, with applications in as diverse fields as photovoltaics, cellular scaffolds and transdermal drug delivery. Much of my work involved optimising the experimental conditions and devising new techniques to control the formation of nano- and meso-structures.
