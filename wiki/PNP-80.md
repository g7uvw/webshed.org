PNP-80 - An 80m band receiver using only PNP transistors
--------------------------------------------------------

The idea for this project came when I bought 200 unknown transistors for
Â£1 at a radio rally a few years ago. On getting them home I discovered
they were PNP and measured a gain of about 250. I thought it might be
fun to build a radio using just these, then put them away and forgot all
about it for two years.

They have a Motorola logo and part number, but no datasheet I've found
seems to match these parts. Barring more information, I've decided to
use these parts as essentially plastic cased PNP BC108 companions.

The 80m band is pretty active at any time and the low frequency requires
very little from components in a receiver, this is especially suited
when you know almost nothing about the parts you've set out to build
with.
