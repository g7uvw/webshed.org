== G7UVW QRSS Beacon ==
After seeing lots of information and designs and grabbed QRSS signals I've decided to have ago at getting a beacon on the air for some tests. The 10.140 MHz xtal was supplied by Chris G8OCV and the xtal oven was a rally find a couple of years ago.

'''Oscillator'''<br/>
The oscillator is pretty much a straight clone of [http://www.hanssummers.com/radio/qrssjb/phase1/index.htm Hans Summers' junk box QRSS beacon] but with a smaller inductor in series with the xtal and a proper AM radio varicap (taken from a dead radio) instead of an LED for frequency shifting.

The whole thing is built on a small scrap of veroboard so that it will fit inside the aluminum box of my xtal oven.  I decided to oven the whole oscillator instead of just the xtal for better frequency stability.

The white stuff at the bottom of the oven block is white-tak just to electrically insulate the board from the metal block and hold the board fairly solidly.
