RTL\_433 Data Decoding
----------------------

#### The motivation

There are lots of low power, license free data transmitters on the 70cms
(433 MHz) band. A large number of these are personal weather station
sensors - others are tire pressure gauges in car wheels, wireless door
bells and car remote locking systems.

I have a couple of cheap remote temperature sensors located in the
garden - they feed data back to a clock (the kit was in an end of line
sale from Maplin Electronics in the UK). Looking inside them reveled a
433 MHz SAW oscillator block.

I was interested to see if I could receive these sensors, and any others
in the local area with a RTL SDR dongle.

#### The software

I did some experiments with recording a bunch of signals in the band
(around 433.820 MHz +/- 30 KHz - the oscillators are not very accurate).
Looking at the audio recording in [baudline](http://www.baudline.com/)
and [audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) revealed obvious data
bits, but decoding the signals by eye wasn't much fun. Then I found
[RTL\_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433), some software that
automatically decodes many data transmissions off-air directly with an
[RTL Dongle](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/).
