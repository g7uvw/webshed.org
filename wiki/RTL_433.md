RTL\_433 Data Decoding
----------------------

#### The motivation

There are lots of low power, license free data transmitters on the 70cms
(433 MHz) band. A large number of these are personal weather station
sensors - others are tire pressure gauges in car wheels, wireless door
bells and car remote locking systems.

I have a couple of cheap remote temperature sensors located in the
garden - they feed data back to a clock (the kit was in an end of line
sale from Maplin Electronics in the UK). Looking inside them reveled a
433 MHz SAW oscillator block.

I was interested to see if I could receive these sensors, and any others
in the local area with a RTL SDR dongle.

#### The software

I did some experiments with recording a bunch of signals in the band
(around 433.820 MHz +/- 30 KHz - the oscillators are not very accurate).
Looking at the audio recording in [baudline](http://www.baudline.com/)
and [audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) revealed obvious data
bits, but decoding the signals by eye wasn't much fun. Then I found
[RTL\_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433), some software that
automatically decodes many data transmissions off-air directly with an
[RTL Dongle](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/).

Building RTL\_433 on OSX was just a matter of following the instructions
on the website, making sure you had a recent install of the main RTLSDR
software first. I've no idea about making this work on MS Windows,
sorry.

#### Testing

I connected the RTL dongle to the 2m/70cms colinear on my roof, to get
the best RF footprint and receive from as many data senders as possible.

The command line I used to start of the software is

    rtl_433 -f 433820000 -s 300000 -p 66 -l 50

Which translates as tune to 433.82MHz (**-f 432820000**), sample at 300
KHz (**-s 300000**), the tuner has 66 PPM error in frequency (**-p 66**)
and set the discrimination level to 50 (**-l 50**).

These settings worked well for me. Data started arriving almost
instantly. I could receive several remote weather sensors from different
manufactures and the occasional doorbell notification too. An example
capture session is in the collapsed text below.

It's interesting to see how bad many of the weather station readings
are. I know I'm making these recordings on a dark and stormy night.. but
I really doubt humidity is 200+% with over a meter of rain. This may be
because not all the data is backed up by a CRC checksum or other error
correcting codes.

I'll update this page as I figure out more details from the sensors.
