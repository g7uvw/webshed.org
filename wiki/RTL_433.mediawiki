== RTL_433 Data Decoding ==

==== The motivation ====
There are lots of low power, license free data transmitters on the 70cms (433 MHz) band. A large number of these are personal weather station sensors - others are tire pressure gauges in car wheels, wireless door bells and car remote locking systems.

I have a couple of cheap remote temperature sensors located in the garden - they feed data back to a clock (the kit was in an end of line sale from Maplin Electronics in the UK). Looking inside them reveled a 433 MHz SAW oscillator block. 

I was interested to see if I could receive these sensors, and any others in the local area with a RTL SDR dongle.

==== The software ====
I did some experiments with recording a bunch of signals in the band (around 433.820 MHz +/- 30 KHz - the oscillators are not very accurate). Looking at the audio recording in [http://www.baudline.com/ baudline] and [http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ audacity] revealed obvious data bits, but decoding the signals by eye wasn't much fun. Then I found [https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433 RTL_433], some software that automatically decodes many data transmissions off-air directly with an [http://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/ RTL Dongle].

Building RTL_433 on OSX was just a matter of following the instructions on the website, making sure you had a recent install of the main RTLSDR software first. I've no idea about making this work on MS Windows, sorry.

==== Testing ====
I connected the RTL dongle to the 2m/70cms colinear on my roof, to get the best RF footprint and receive from as many data senders as possible. 

The command line I used to start of the software is
<pre>
rtl_433 -f 433820000 -s 300000 -p 66 -l 50
</pre>

Which translates as tune to 433.82MHz ('''-f 432820000'''), sample at 300 KHz ('''-s 300000'''), the tuner has 66 PPM error in  frequency ('''-p 66''') and set the discrimination level to 50 ('''-l 50'''). 

These settings worked well for me. Data started arriving almost instantly. I could receive several remote weather sensors from different manufactures and the occasional doorbell notification too. An example capture session is in the collapsed text below.

It's interesting to see how bad many of the weather station readings are. I know I'm making these recordings on a dark and stormy night.. but I really doubt humidity is 200+% with over a meter of rain. This may be because not all the data is backed up by a CRC checksum or other error correcting codes. 

I'll update this page as I figure out more details from the sensors.
