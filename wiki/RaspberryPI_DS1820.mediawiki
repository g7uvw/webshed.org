== How to use the DS1820 / DS18s20 / DS18b20 with the Raspberry PI  ==

So you've got a shiny new rPI and want to connect it to some sensors - the 1-wire bus is a good way to do so. A bunch of devices can be connected to just three pins on the rPI GPIO connector. 

For this example I'm connecting a temperature sensor, a DS1820 (but the configuration is identical for other parts in the same series: DS18s20 &amp; DS18b20). The DS1820 VDD and GND pins are connected to the rPI 3.3V and GND pins respectively. The DQ pin is connected to GPIO-4, a 4k7 resistor connected between DQ and VDD is required to enable the sensor. <br>

I&nbsp;built my breakout interface directly onto a plastic pin header for testing purposes, but this is hardly the best way to do it.<br>
