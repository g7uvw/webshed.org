Research Interests
------------------

I've always been interested in the interaction of radiation and matter -
from high energy particle physics to lasers and x-rays.

I now work on the [Apocalypto Project](http://apocalypto.org.uk/)
applying x-ray CT scanning to the reading of ancient parchments and
papers that are too degraded and damaged to read by conventional means.

My PhD was in the area of laser - surface interactions and structure
formation, with applications in as diverse fields as photovoltaics,
cellular scaffolds and transdermal drug delivery. Much of my work
involved optimising the experimental conditions and devising new
techniques to control the formation of nano- and meso-structures.

My achievements in this field include the first production of large
areas of silicon micro pillars (black-Si), explanations of the various
observed growth modes of the pillars and the first simple,
non-lithographic technique to produce large area ordered arrays of
pillars. With [Kurt Kolasinski](http://courses.wcupa.edu/kkolasinski/) I
was the first to describe [Solidification Driven
Extrusion](/wiki/Solidification_Driven_Extrusion "wikilink") and how it forms
nano-spikes on textured silicon surfaces.

[Kurt's textbook](http://courses.wcupa.edu/kkolasinski/surfacescience/)
is an excellent primer on surface science in general and nanoscience.
