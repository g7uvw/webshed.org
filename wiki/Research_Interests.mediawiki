My PhD was in the area of laser - surface interactions and structure formation, with applications in as diverse fields as photovoltaics, cellular scaffolds and transdermal drug delivery. Much of my work involved optimising the experimental conditions and devising new techniques to control the formation of nano- and meso-structures.
