A simple signal injector for troubleshooting radio receivers
------------------------------------------------------------

A signal injector is a low power oscillator that generates a signal and
lots of harmonics in the audio and low frequency RF spectrum. This
allows you to test both the audio and RF stages of a radio receiver.
They are very simple to built and every work bench should have one.

#### The circuit

The basic circuit for for signal injector is an Astable Oscillator - two
transistors configured to alternately switch the state of the other
transistor. ![](Astable.png "fig:Astable.png")
