== A simple signal injector for troubleshooting radio receivers ==

A signal injector is a low power oscillator that generates a signal and lots of harmonics in the audio and low frequency RF spectrum. This allows you to test both the audio and RF stages of a radio receiver. They are very simple to built and every work bench should have one.

==== The circuit ====

The basic circuit for for signal injector is an Astable Oscillator -  two transistors configured to alternately switch the state of the other transistor.

The oscillator's operating frequency is set by R2, R3 and C1 & C2. 

<math>f = \frac{1}{T}

= \frac{1}{\ln(2) \cdot (R_2 C_1 + R_3 C_2)}

\approx \frac{1}{0.693 \cdot (R_2 C_1 + R_3 C_2)}</math>

where...
* ''f'' is [[frequency]] in [[hertz]].
* ''R''<sub>2</sub> and ''R''<sub>3</sub> are resistor values in ohms.
* ''C''<sub>1</sub> and ''C''<sub>2</sub> are capacitor values in farads.
* ''T'' is the period (In this case, the sum of two period durations).

The output approximates a square wave with the duty cycle controlled by the values of R2 and R3. In the case where R2 = R3, the duty cycle is very close to 50% and the circuit produces a reasonable square wave - this is not really what we want. A square wave is comprised only of odd harmonics, ideally we'd like both the odd and even harmonics so that there is a signal close to wherever the radio is tuned.
