== A simple signal injector for troubleshooting radio receivers ==

A signal injector is a low power oscillator that generates a signal and lots of harmonics in the audio and low frequency RF spectrum. This allows you to test both the audio and RF stages of a radio receiver. They are very simple to built and every work bench should have one.

==== The circuit ====

The basic circuit for for signal injector is an Astable Oscillator -  two transistors configured to alternately switch the state of the other transistor.
