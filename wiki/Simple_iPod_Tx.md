A simple FM transmitter for the iPod & other devices
----------------------------------------------------

A friend wanted to connect her iPod to her home stereo system, but said
stereo doesn't have any external inputs. The simplest solution, avoiding
diving into the wiring in the stereo, is to transmit the audio from the
iPod to the FM radio in the stereo system. This gave me the opportunity
to play with [Tetsuo Kogawaâ€™s MicroFM transmitter
design](http://anarchy.translocal.jp/radio/micro/howtosimplestTX.html)
as featured recently on [Mark VandeWettering's](http://brainwagon.org/)
website.
