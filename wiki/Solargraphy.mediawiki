Some time ago, Make Magazine featured an [http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/02/lovely_solargraphy_photos.html article] regarding pinhole photography of the path of the sun over a six month period. The article introduced the work of [http://www.solargraphy.com/ Tarja Trygg], having an interest in photography I decided to have a go myself.

I had planned to have the cameras ready and in place for the winter solstice, so I could capture an entire half period of the sun, from lowest (21 December) to highest (21 June); however I didn't quite manage to get everything ready in time. The first cameras will hopefully be in position by the second week of January.


== Howto: As far as I understand it... ==
You need four things:
# A beer can - you can start with a full one, but it needs to be empty to make the pinhole camera, so get drinking.
# A tool to cut off the top of the can
# Some positive (lit areas go black) photographic paper.
# Gaffer / Duct tape.

'''Here's how you combine them.'''<br/>
1. Empty the beer can. It's worth rinsing it out with clean water now, else you'll probably spill beer dregs over yourself as you cut the top off the can.<br/>
2. Using a rotary cutter or scissors or some other tool, remove the top of the beer can.<br/>
3. It's worth processing several cans at once.

4. I gave my cans a coat of black spray paint inside, to help kill any stray reflections, but this is entirely optional and I've no idea if it is worth actually doing.

5. Make a pinhole about half way down the length of the can. I used a 0.3mm sewing needle, I think this is large enough without being too large. I'll find out in six months... You'll need to cover the hole with opaque tape.

6. In a dark room load the paper into the camera. Matt side against the can walls, shiny side facing in to the can. The paper should be opposite the pinhole. Don't let the paper cover the pinhole. I did this step in my dark bathroom with just a red LED on a half dead battery as the only light. Let your eyes adjust to the light before you start this step.

7. As soon as the camera is loaded, cover up the open end with gaffer tape. You want it light tight. Don't be afraid to use more tape.
