Some time ago, Make Magazine featured an [http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/02/lovely_solargraphy_photos.html article] regarding pinhole photography of the path of the sun over a six month period. The article introduced the work of [http://www.solargraphy.com/ Tarja Trygg], having an interest in photography I decided to have a go myself.

I had planned to have the cameras ready and in place for the winter solstice, so I could capture an entire half period of the sun, from lowest (21 December) to highest (21 June); however I didn't quite manage to get everything ready in time. The first cameras will hopefully be in position by the second week of January.
