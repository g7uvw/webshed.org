== Some experiments with vacuum tubes ==

I've wanted to build a radio (either RX or TX) with a vacuum tube or two. This page will document my attempts at getting familiar with this old technology.

===== The basics =====

Looking in my collection of tubes, I had a bunch of common types to pick from for experiments, most being pentodes. I hoped that ignoring the grids (leaving them floating) while putting some volts between Anode and Cathode would cause a current to flow when the filament was lit. I tried this with the couple of EF91s I had in the collection with no results; it's possible the tubes are dead.

The other tube type I had a few new old stock (never used, still in original packaging) were EF86 low noise audio amplifier pentodes. Again leaving the grids floating didn't let any current flow though the tube, however unlike the EF91s I tried, grounding the grids did cause a current to flow.

The resistor and neon combination limit anode current to around 50 &micro;A. The neon starts to glow before the meter needle even starts to move. This circuit was lased together on the bench with crocodile clips connecting to the tube's pins. I'll need some proper bases before I can try to make the valves do my bidding - crocodile clips are a bit cumbersome to say the least.
