== A simple USB digi-modes radio interface ==

I've been wanting to try out digital modes on the HF and VHF bands for some time, receiving is easy - you just need a connection between the radio and the computer's soundcard line-in port. Transmission is a little more complex, depending on both the radio used and the software on the computer. You often have the option of either feeding data from the soundcard to the radio's mic socket and using an RS232 serial port to control the PTT line, or doing all the data transmission via the serial port and only using the soundcard for reception.  There are various DIY and commercial designs for both types of interface, this page documents my version built for as little money as possible using parts from ebay and the poundshop.

I want an entirely self contained interface, one USB connection to the computer and the necessary connections to the radio. To achieve this I need at least three things, a USB hub, a USB soundcard and a USB to RS232 converter. A quick trawl though ebay turned up the soundcard and the RS232 adaptor.
