Some weather graphs.
====================

This page is more for my own general interest then anything else, it's
just a collection of weather data from
[sensors](/wiki/RaspberryPI_Multiple_DS1820 "wikilink") I've installed at my
home. For now it's just logging temperature, but IÂ hope to add other
measurements in the future.
