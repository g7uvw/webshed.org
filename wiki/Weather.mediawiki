= Some weather graphs.  =

This page is more for my own general interest then anything else, it's just a collection of weather data from [[RaspberryPI Multiple DS1820|sensors]] I've installed at my home. I've added a DT11 humidity sensor and a BMP085 pressure sensor to the data collection system. They are all connected directly to the rPI's GPIO pins for now, but I'll soon move them over to a dedicated micro-controller, so as to reduce the load on the rPI (bit-banging 1-wire and the strange encoding the DHT11 sensor uses locks up the rPI at times).
