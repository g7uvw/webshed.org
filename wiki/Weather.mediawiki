= Some weather graphs.  =

This page is more for my own general interest then anything else, it's just a collection of weather data from [[RaspberryPI Multiple DS1820|sensors]] I've installed at my home. For now it's just logging temperature, but I&nbsp;hope to add other measurements in the future.
