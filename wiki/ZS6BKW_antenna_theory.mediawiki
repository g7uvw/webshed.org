== Introduction  ==

Wire antennas with open wire feeder matching stubs have interested me for a number of years; from the ubiquitous G5RV and the optimized ZS6BKW designs, to doublets and similar antennas, the wire feeder is an integral part of the design. The feeder forms a transmission line transformer, matching the impedance of the antenna's feed point to that of the RF source.

== The ZS6BKW multi-band antenna  ==

The ZS6BKW is the multiband antenna I use at home and at the Kelvedon Hatch secret nuclear bunker special even station - GB0SNB, so it is the one I will investigate a the operation of. The antenna is constructed from 27.5m of wire (2 x 13.75 elements) fed with either 13.3m of 300 Ohm or 12.2m of 450 Ohm open wire feeder. 

Good matching to a 50 Ohm RF source (SWR &lt; 2) is achieved on the following bands: 40, 20, 17, 12, 10, and 6 meters. Use of an ATU allows 80m and 15m to be matched too. 

How does a short length of open wire feeder manage this? Read on.

== Mathematics  ==

Antenna design and analysis really requires mathematics, you can try to short cut the maths by experimentation, but you're never going to really develop anything new or any understanding of what's going on without at least a little maths. The Telegrapher's Equations describe the behaviour of voltages and current on a transmission line as a function of time and distance from the source (for a lossless line) 

:<math>
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} I(x,t) =
-C \frac{\partial}{\partial t} V(x,t)
</math>

:<math>
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} V(x,t) =
-L \frac{\partial}{\partial t} I(x,t)
</math>


It can be shown (but I'm not doing it here) that in the case of a sinusoidal signal on a transmission line of length <span class="texhtml">''d''</span> with characteristic impedance <span class="texhtml">''Z''<sub>0</sub></span> terminated with a load impedance <span class="texhtml">''Z''<sub>''L''</sub></span>, the input impedance <span class="texhtml">''Z''<sub>''i''''n'''''</sub></span>of the line is given by: 

:<math>
Z_{in}(d) = \frac{Z_L cos\beta d + jZ_0 sin \beta d}{Z_0 cos \beta d + j Z_L sin \beta d}
</math>

where <math>\beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}

</math> 

'''A simple example:''' 

It is commonly known that a λ/2 (half-wave) length of feeder presents to the radio the same impedance as the antenna it is connected to, regardless of the feeder characteristic impedance. Using the the above equation for Z<sub>in</sub> we can plot the value of Z<sub>in</sub> vs feeder length for a simple monoband dipole.

We shall take λ to be 40m, <span class="texhtml">''Z''<sub>''L''</sub></span> = 73 Ohm (assuming perfect ideal dipole) and <span class="texhtml">''Z''<sub>0</sub></span> = 450 Ohm

The plot clearly shows that when the feeder length is 20m, the impedance is 73 Ohm - just as is expected. We can also see that the plot is cyclical, we get the same impedance transference at 40m, 60m and 80m (though the last two are inferred, not shown). Inspecting the plot, we can also see that if the feeder length is 10m (lambda/4) the impedance drops to around zero - giving what is commonly known as a "current node" where you have to force essentially infinite current into the antenna to get any radiation. We can also pick our feeder length to give any impedance we like between 0 and 73 Ohms.

= The ZS6BKW analyzed  =

To start analaysing this antenna we first need to know <span class="texhtml">''Z''<sub>''L''</sub></span> at the frequencies of interest. We can't just use 73 Ohm as in the simple 40m dipole example, because the dimensions of the ZS6BKW are not those of a simple dipole on any of the bands we are interested in. To avoid a lot of mathematics, I used CocoaNEC antenna modeling software to compute <span class="texhtml">''Z''<sub>''L''</sub></span>. The model assumes the antenna is 30 feet high, constructed from 2 mm<sup>2</sup> copper wire over a standard NEC ground simulation. 

== 40m  ==

Running the model for the 40m (7 MHz) band, we get the following complex impedances at the feed point of the antennna: 

Frequency 7.000 MHz - Z: (213.460 + i 650.080)<br>Frequency 7.050 MHz - Z: (221.760 + i 670.960)<br>Frequency 7.100 MHz - Z: (230.400 + i 692.090)<br>Frequency 7.150 MHz - Z: (239.390 + i 713.470)<br>Frequency 7.200 MHz - Z: (248.750 + i 735.100)

This corresponds to ~45:1 VSWR to a 50 Ohm source, obviously we need to transform this down. To simplify the graph, I'll only use the 7.1 MHz data - it's the middle of the European band, and the band is narrow enough that whatever works midband should be ok at the band edges too.

From the plot it is easy to see that we can get 50 Ohm impedance if we use a feeder of length either 7.5m or 12.5m. A current node can be seen with a feeder length of 10m.

In doing this analysis, I did not consider the complex part of the of the antenna feedpoint impedance. This is because I am not yet sure exactly what happens with regards to transformed complex impedance, and because the results I get by ignoring them correspond very well to the results measured in real world versions of this antenna.
