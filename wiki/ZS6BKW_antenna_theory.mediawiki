== Introduction ==

Wire antennas with open wire feeder matching stubs have interested me for a number of years; from the ubiquitous G5RV and the optimized ZS6BKW designs, to  doublets and similar antennas, the wire feeder is an integral part of the design. The feeder forms a transmission line transformer, matching the impedance of the antenna's feed point to that of the RF source.


== The ZS6BKW multi-band antenna ==

The ZS6BKW is the multiband antenna I use at home and at the Kelvedon Hatch secret nuclear bunker special even station - GB0SNB, so it is the one I will investigate a the operation of.

The ZS6BKW antenna is 27.5m of wire (2 x 13.75 elements) fed with either 300 or 450 Ohm open wire feeder around 13m long. A common configuration uses 12.2m of 450 Ohm feeder
